# Pi-OS

[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/pi-os/badge/?version=latest)](https://pi-os.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)

Pi-OS is a research OS made to explore depending types and OS dev.

The [blog](https://rafaelriv.github.io/piblog/) is where updates get published.

Pi-OS is developed jointly with two operating systems written in [ATS](https://github.com/rafaelRiv/a-os) and [Rust](https://github.com/rafaelRiv/r-os). The goal is to explore concepts used by ATS and RUST in system development and see if they make sense to import into Idris2.
Those two OS exists only to support the development of Pi-OS and thus will never be complete OS.
