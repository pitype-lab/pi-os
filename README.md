# Pi-OS

[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/pi-os/badge/?version=latest)](https://pi-os.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)

Pi-OS is a research os made to explore depending types and os dev.

The [blog](https://rafaelriv.github.io/piblog/) is where updates get published.

Pi-OS is developed jointly with two operating systems written in [ATS] (https://github.com/rafaelRiv/a-os) and [RUST] (https://github.com/rafaelRiv/r-os). The goal is to explore the concepts used by ATS and RUST in system development and see if they make sense to import into Idris
